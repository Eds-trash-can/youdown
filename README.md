# DISCONTINUED! cuz i found out about kodi

# YouDown - youtube like media interface

Please keep in mind this is an early WIP

# Get it up:

- clone repo
- cd into downloaded dir
- "npm install -g typescript"
- "npm install youdown" ("npm install youdown-02" for very old versions )
- "npm run test" 
- visit the page! (http://localhost:8080/)
- also you need to edit the json files manualy to add videos / channels

Random stuff:

# "working" (TM)

- "/" - renderer for fist 4-8 videos (depending on screen size)
- "/watch/" - videoplayer 
- "/settings/" - overview of stats
- "/settings/yt" - youtube api interface
  - by channel-name u can search for youtube channel, choose one from search results, in dev tools a "results"-var will be available with all videos of the choosen youtuber

# TODO: 

The trello board: https://trello.com/b/RlMFODZb/youdown (outdated af no rly it dosnt even contain half the things implemented or WIPs)
if you actually want to know whats WIP and whats planned look in code files stuff like static/lib/* these files contain decent dokumentation. (at least i think so)
