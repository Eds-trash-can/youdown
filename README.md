# YouDown - youtube like mediainterface

Please keep in mind this is an early WIP

# Get it up:

- clone repo
- configure npm
- "npm run test"
- visit the link! (http://localhost:8080/)
- also you need to edit the json files manualy to add videos / channels

Random stuff:

# "working"

- "/" renderer for fist 4-8 videos
- "/watch/" videoplayer
